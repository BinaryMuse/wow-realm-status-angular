WoW Realm Status Page: AngularJS Edition
========================================

This is a version of my [JavaScript WoW Realm Status Page](https://github.com/BinaryMuse/wow-realm-status-js) implemented using [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) instead of Backbone.

Application logic is implemented in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) in `js/app.coffee` and is compiled to JavaScript via the CoffeeScript command-line tool:

    coffee -c -b js/app.coffee

The original Ruby version can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/BinaryMuse/wow-realm-status.
